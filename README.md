# quad
electrical layout + code for a small quadcopter that fits on a single board

Overall design:
- Brushed Motors
- Off the shelf radio (may tweak design to make a custom receiver + radio transmitter pai)
- State estimation done with BNO085
- MCU is a raspberry pi pico (RP2040)

The goal of this project is for the design to be:
- easy to understand
- easy to manufacture
- easy to extend
